> Visualize JSON with JSONPath querying

### ‚ú® [Demo](https://vigorous-euler-fd1608.netlify.app/)

## What it does?
- Reads a JSON file and renders a beautiful tree visualization
- Supports [JSONPath](https://restfulapi.net/json-jsonpath/) querying to highlight matching nodes
- Allows inspection of individual nodes/node-ranges
- Theming!: Choose from 37 awesome themes styled with [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16)

## Implementation
- Built with TypeScript, React.js with Redux state management
- Tree rendering done using [react-json-tree](https://github.com/itsfadnis/react-json-tree). A fork of the react tree component used by redux-devtools(https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools/blob/master/packages/)
- Progressive rendering, to handle large JSON.  Nodes are rendered upto a limit, while the rest of the nodes are rendered as node ranges. Matching nodes are highlighted and expanded. Matching node-ranges are highlighted and expandable. The idea is to highlight matching nodes/node paths, without having to render way too many nodes.
- JSON files are read using the [FileReader API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader)

## Further optimization?
- JSON streaming for huge files that can't be read/parsed in-memory
- Introduce a service worker to handle querying, so as to keep the main thread responsive in case the computation is super expensive
- I'm sure there could be lots more...
